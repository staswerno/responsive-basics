## viewport units

The four different viewport units are:

- vw (viewport width): 10vw would be 10% of the viewport's width.
- vh (viewport height): 3vh would be 3% of the viewport's height.
- vmin (viewport minimum): 70vmin would be 70% of the viewport's smaller dimension (height or width).
- vmax (viewport maximum): 100vmax would be 100% of the viewport's bigger dimension (height or width).
